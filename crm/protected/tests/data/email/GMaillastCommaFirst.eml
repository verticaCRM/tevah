Subject: calendar editing
To: Sales Rep <sales@rep.com>


 I have set both roles for a user to Calendar=Full Access. I have had the
 user log out and log back in. She is still unable to edit the description
 for a calendar event. She can drag and drop for time, but not description.
 The action's id is %123%.
