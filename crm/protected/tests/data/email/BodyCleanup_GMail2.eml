Hello Customer!

Thank you so much for purchasing a hosted account with X2Engine! My name is
Haley, and I am a Sales and Marketing Representative. Please feel free to
reach out to me at any time. We appreciate your business and are looking
forward to working with you. You should have already received an email that
will take you through the set up process for your virtual private server.

For access to your X2Engine Virtual Private Server (VPS), you will be granted
a free subdomain of x2vps.com of your choosing in addition to the one it is
given initially. If you own a domain name that you wish to user for your
VPS, you may use that as well. To specify a subdomain name or associate a
domain name with your VPS, please send an email to
customersupport@x2engine.com or open a support
case<http://www.x2engine.com/open-a-support-case/>,
beginning the subject/description with "Domain name change:"

As to the dropbox, here is a short video about how to use the functionality:

Essentially, after set up, you can BCC or CC your dropbox (as I did on
this email) and X2Engine will recognize the email and attach the
correspondence onto the account record.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments you
may have. I would be very interested to hear about your company and how you
decided on X2Engine. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you enjoy
using X2Engine!
