Greetings, Test!

Thank you for forwarding me that email; it allowed me to capture the raw
format and generate a new pattern so that the forwarding use case will
support Zimbra's attached forwarded message format. This pattern will
formally be included in the next release, but I have taken the liberty of
loading it into the database on your VPS so that it will be available right
away.

FYI, all VPS customers get the email dropbox functionality automatically
set up for them during the provisioning process. As described in the
installation
wiki article<http://wiki.x2engine.com/wiki/Installation#Configuring_the_.22Email_Dropbox.22>on
its setup, doing it manually involves a few extra server-end
configuration steps. Not having to deal with that is one major advantage of
our VPS hosting.

To use the email dropbox:

Method 1: Send an email *to* the contact and, in the CC field, put
dropbox@testdomain.com, and it will be appended to the contact record
as an email-type action. It's similar to what I'm doing with this email.
Method 2: Forward an email sent *from* the contact directly to
dropbox@testdomain.com, and it will be appended to the contact record
as a note-type action ("contact sent email")

If you have any suggestions or feature requests, or run into any problems,
please do not hesitate to ask. You can email me at this address, or submit
a support case, or ask on our forums (at x2community.com, where we'll grant
you access to the private priority forum).
