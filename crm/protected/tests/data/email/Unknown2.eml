Hi Redacted,

Thank you for responding, and I will be testing the forwarded message forma=
t. I agree that your use case is very sensible. Originally, the request was=
 to design it as a contact importer as well as an email importer, but the u=
se case you described was not considered. I will try to fit the option to c=
ontrol the behavior into the upcoming release. If not, you can expect it ve=
ry soon; advanced self-service (but to begin with, a settings page) for the=
 dropbox feature has been requested and in the works for some time.%123%

Hi Developer,

I greatly appreciate your response.  Right now we are using Office Outlook =

to not create new contacts if the email doesn't exist?  The reason I ask th=
is is we are working with our hosting provider to set it up to where it wil=

 sent to someone within our contact database it will automatically append t=

Hi Redacted,

I understand you have had some questions about the email dropbox feature av=
ailable in X2Engine Professional Edition, and would like to clarify on a few p=
oints.

First, there are two methods of using the dropbox feature:

1. Send an email to the contact, and CC the dropbox alias on your server (a=
s I am doing in this email). The email will be attached to the contact reco=
rd matching the addressee's email address (if the contact exists). If the c=
ontact does not exist, the email parsing script will create it using the co=
ntact information in the addressee field. If you send to multiple addresses=
, it will do the same thing for all of them. This method is reliable and wo=
rks with all email software.

2. Forward an email sent from a contact to the dropbox alias. The email par=
sing script will attempt to gather contact information from out of the forw=
arded message's header, and attach the email / create the contact as it wou=
ld using the first method. However, due to how different email programs for=
mat attached forwarded messages differently, the script must be extended to=
 add support for more email programs so that it can correctly recognize for=
warded message headers.* Currently it supports GMail, Apple Mail, Outlook O=
nline, and an older version of Outlook that one of our design partners uses=
.

I would thus like to offer to test your email software for compatibility, a=
nd add support for it if it isn't already compatible. To do this, please fo=
rward this email message back to me (instead of replying) and let me know t=
he name of the email client program or webmail that you are using. I am off=
ering to do this not only because you have expressed interest in purchasing=
 X2Engine Professional, and I would like to ensure that the forwarded method w=
orks properly for your software in the upcoming release, but because it wou=
ld be generally advantageous to be able to support more types of email soft=
ware.

* Since there is not yet any 100% reliable heuristic for reconstructing ema=
il threads, and this is still in fact a rather advanced topic in computer s=
cience, the email dropbox simply uses regular expressions and uses the firs=
t match for a forwarded message that it finds in the body.
