Hi Developer
Thanks, this sounds great! One issue I have is setting up my email and using
crm. I use thunderbird for my email, wish gmail was free for businesses.

Everything is good. I have been out for almost 10 days with packing, moving
and unpacking. We relocated to South Carolina, right outside of Charleston.

Starting to get back in the swing.

Hello Redacted,
%123%
I am currently working on an email parser that will allow you to import 
emails and contacts directly into X2Engine by sending emails to a mail 
alias on the server. As it stands, it's capable of  creating contacts 
(if they don't already exist) and associated email-type actions 
(including the body of the email) by CC-ing 
"dropbox@crm.redacted.com 
<mailto:dropbox@crm.redacted.com>" whenever you email a lead. 
However, I'll soon make it possible to directly forward email from a 
lead to the alias, and have the parser do the same thing but without 
having to send email back to the lead. To finish this part, I will need 
you to forward this email back to me using your email software of 
choice. That will allow me to get a good look at the format of the 
forwarded/attached email so that I can adjust the parser to accommodate 
it and it can work properly on your VPS. In time, more advanced features 
will be added as well.

Sincerely,
- Developer

P.S. How have things been going?
